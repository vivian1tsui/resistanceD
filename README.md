## Datasets
We select a large set of real-world networks from [Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.cc/) and [Network Repository](https://networkrepository.com/).  The collected networks are scale-free small-world, and are highly representative, spanning different fields such as social science, biology, and information science.
